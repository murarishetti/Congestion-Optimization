# Congestion-Optimization

The project is to design an Algorithm that finds the shortest path in the presence of congestion between a set of source and destination paths. The main objective of the project is to decrease the variance between the actual and the predicted shortest path. 

1. The Algorithm was implemented in C++. 
2. The Shortest Path Calculation is done with Dijkstra's Algorithm. 
3. The Predicted Shortest Path is different from the Actual Shortest Path because of the congestion between the source and destination paths.
